# Description
This project I made as graduation project for Deep Learning School of MIPT. **Project score: 8.0 / 10.0**\
There are I will use pretrained on VGGFace2 neural network (InceptionResnetV1) for face recognition on a CelebA dataset.

# Tasks
1. Build a neural network for faces classification\
**Test accuracy with Cross Entropy loss = 91.88%**

2. Implement identificaton rate metric â€“ TPR @ FPR
3. Implement a model and train it with Triplet and Additive Angular Margin Loss functions\
**Test accuracy with Triplet loss: 88.420%**\
**Test accuracy with ArcFace loss: 93.581%**

4. Finding trash photos:
